/*
Course Interface:
 Define a Course interface with the following methods:
 double getCourseFee()
 String getCourseStartTime()
 String getCourseEndTime()
 void printCourseDescription()
 void printEnrolledStudents()
 void enrollStudent(Student student)
 void unenrollStudent(Student student)
OnlineCourse and OnCampusCourse:
 Create two abstract classes, OnlineCourse and OnCampusCourse,
 that implement the Course interface. These classes should:
 Implement the necessary methods from the Course interface.
 Store basic course-related information such as course fee, timings,
 and type (online or on-campus).
 Maintain a unique list of enrolled students using a HashSet<Student>.
Student Class:
 Define a Student class to store basic student information such as name, age, and student ID.
 Course Implementations:
 Create two concrete classes:
 ProgrammingCourse, which extends OnlineCourse.
 MathematicsCourse, which extends OnCampusCourse.
 Each class should define specific course-related fields and implement any abstract methods.
Main Program:
 In the main program, create 10 instances of the Student class and assign some of them to
 either the ProgrammingCourse or  MathematicsCourse then test your interface functions one by
  one
