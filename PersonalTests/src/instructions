/*
You are tasked with designing a vehicle rental system. The system will manage different
types of vehicles (cars and motorcycles) and customers who can rent these vehicles.
You will need to implement:

Vehicle Interface:
Define a Vehicle interface with the following methods:
String getLicensePlate()
String getVehicleType()
double getRentalPricePerDay()
void printVehicleDetails()
void printRentedBy()
void rentVehicle(Customer customer)
void returnVehicle(Customer customer)

Car and Motorcycle Classes:
Create two abstract classes, Car and Motorcycle, that implement the Vehicle interface.
These classes should:
Implement the necessary methods from the Vehicle interface.
Store basic vehicle-related information such as license plate, vehicle type,
and rental price.
Maintain a list of customers who have rented the vehicles using an array or ArrayList.
Customer Class:

Define a Customer class to store basic customer information such as name, age, and customer ID.
Vehicle Implementations:
Create two concrete classes:
Sedan, which extends Car.
SportBike, which extends Motorcycle.
Each class should define specific vehicle-related fields and implement any abstract methods.

Main Program:
In the main program, create 10 instances of the Customer class and assign some of them to rent either a Sedan or a SportBike.
After renting and returning some vehicles, print out the details of the vehicles and which customers have rented them.
